# PreToolUse hook: warn about in-flight or pending doc updates before
# `git commit`. Non-blocking — reminds the user but allows the commit.
#
# Fires when `git commit ...` is about to run AND any of:
#   (a) the Stop hook's sub-Claude updater was spawned recently
#       (lock file `/tmp/lucystarter-diagram-update.lock` is fresh)
#   (b) memory/ai/diagrams/ has unstaged changes
#   (c) CLAUDE.md has unstaged changes
#
# Rationale: the Stop hook spawns the diagram updater detached, so
# there's a 30-120 second race window where you can commit before
# the sub-Claude's unstaged edits land. This hook reminds you at the
# exact moment it matters — when you're about to commit.
#
# NOTE: We deliberately do NOT use `pgrep -f 'claude -p'` to detect
# a running updater. That pattern matches sub-Claudes from OTHER
# projects on the same machine (e.g. a sibling weatherbot project),
# producing cross-project false positives. The lock file path is
# hardcoded per-project, so its mtime is an unambiguous signal.
